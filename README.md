# Try-Ceph : What is it 

Try-Ceph requires bare mininum work to get your FIRST CEPH CLUSTER running for your testing purpose and learning purpose. Anyone who wants to have a quick look at CEPH , this is the fastes way to get to their first Ceph cluster.

## Try-Ceph features includes

* Quickest way to get your first test Ceph cluster up and running.
* Automated Ceph installation and configuration within the box.
* Installs and configure  ceph-dash : A Ceph graphical dashboard for monitoring.
* Installs and configure Object Storage which is accessible via S3 or Swift API
* User can define number of Monitor and OSD nodes for the Ceph cluster.
* It  uses Vagrant --> Ansible --> Ceph --> Ceph-dash

## Requirements

* Host machine OS - Mac OSX or any LINUX distribution ( tested on CentOS , Ubuntu )
* Virtuliaztion platform - Oracle VirtualBox ( tested ) or VMWare workstation
* Disk Space on host machine - >5GB ( 1 mon & 1 OSD node with 2 OSD's ) 
* Host configuration management - Ansible

## How to get started with Try-Ceph

Prerequiste : Make sure your host machine should comply with the requirements mentioned above. 
Before "vagrant up" operation sometimes   ' git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git:// ' is needed to solve Ceph installation packages.


STEP - 1 : ``` $ git clone https://github.com/ksingh7/Try-Ceph.git ```


```
$ git clone https://github.com/ksingh7/Try-Ceph.git

```

STEP - 1.1 : Install Ansible on the host machine , see the below instructions for your OS

Ubuntu : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-14-04
CentOS : http://www.tecmint.com/install-and-configure-ansible-automation-tool-in-linux/

STEP - 2 : ``` $ cd Try-Ceph ```

```
NOTE : By default vagrant will provision 1 MON and 3 OSD node , if you need more MON / OSD nodes , please change the NMONS and NOSDS parameteraunder  Vagrantfile.
```

STEP - 3 : ``` $ vagrant up ```

```

STEP - 4 : Check Ceph cluster status

```
$ vagrant ssh mon0 -c "sudo ceph -s"
    cluster 10c95f01-2dd2-4863-affa-60c4eafcd8d2
     health HEALTH_OK

$
```

STEP - 5 : To check status of your cluster using Ceph dashboard. Point your host browser to http://192.168.101.10:5000

![Try-Ceph Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksingh7/Try-Ceph/master/screenshot/ceph-dash.png) 

STEP - 6 : To access object storage via S3
* Node mon0 is preconfigured as Ceph Rados Gateway which can be accessed via [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd) tool
``` 
    # vagrant ssh mon0 
    $ sudo su -
    # s3cmd ls                          # List S3 bucket
    # s3cmd mb s3://first-bucket        # Make S3 bucket
    # s3cmd ls                          # List S3 bucket
```
STEP - 7 : To access object storage via SWIFT
* Install swift cli tools to a node that have access to mon0 machine ( 192.168.101.10 )
* Finally access object storage via Swift Call

``` # swift -A http://192.168.101.10/auth/1.0 -U demo:swift -K 'SwiftSecretKey' list ```

## Destro Try-Ceph setup

STEP - 1 : Check status of your  vagrant instances ``` $ vagrant status ```

STEP - 2 : Halt vagrant instances ``` $ vagrant halt mon0 osd0 osd1 osd2 ```

STEP - 3 : Destroy vagrant instances ``` $ vagrant destroy -f mon0 osd0 osd1 osd2 ```
